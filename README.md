# Proof of Concept for a Turn Based City Builder
> Hello!
> This is the exectuable of a Turn Based City Builder project that I worked on recently.
> This project is a proof of concept, it does not contain a full gameplay loop. Instead this was an exploration of the different systems that go into creating a grid based, turn based, city builder game would require.
> Check out the game if you want to! Otherwise this README is going to go through each system that was implemented for this project
